# Automated Data Validation and Reporting Framework for Snowflake Pipelines

This project delivers a robust automation framework for validating data across different stages in Snowflake-based data pipelines. The utility primarily performs count checks and data-level comparisons to ensure consistency between staging and target tables.

It streamlines the testing process by executing predefined validation rules and automatically generating a detailed PDF report summarizing matched records, mismatches, and overall validation status. The solution is designed to be modular, lightweight, and easily integrable with existing CI/CD workflows, enabling faster and more reliable data pipeline testing.

By automating critical validation steps, this framework reduces manual effort, improves data quality, and supports audit-ready reporting for enterprise data platforms.
